Sum Of N Natural numbers

Step:1 > Get the number from user 
            n=5
Step:2 > Hold the number in a variable 
            n=5
Step:3 > Put a variable for sum.
            sum=0
Step:4 > loop the user input number until it's equal to i.
            while(n>0)
            sum=sum+1
Step:5 > on every iteration store the value of i in result  (sum + n) then return.
